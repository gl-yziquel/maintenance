Manifest of repositories undergoing maintenance chores.
=======================================================

We here document the list of repositories on which the author performs maintenance tasks of one kind or another.

* The [legit][legit] repository. A frontend for serving git repositories, rather bare bones. The legit repository is pinned to a version, 0.2.0, where the mismatched pack length that has been hitting the authors is known not to occur. This is a regression being thus documented.
